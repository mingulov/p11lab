# P11Lab

Reusable PKCS#11 provider environments for application development and testing.

P11Lab ships a catalogue of 24 locked provider candidates with pinned
sources, build recipes, and lifecycle adapters, plus the `p11lab` command
for local use: `list`, `describe`, `validate`, `resolve`, `build`,
`install`, `run` (`direct`, `proxy`, and `native` modes), and source-first
delivery gates (`publish`). Providers run containerized runtimes, native
bundles (Debian 13 amd64, Windows x64 for BouncyHSM), and pinned-mTLS
proxy lanes; the installed checker and independent consumers exercise the
same artifacts. Fifteen providers carry full cohort documentation in
[docs/developer-release-cohort.md](docs/developer-release-cohort.md); the
rest are described by their catalogue entries. Nothing here is published
yet: no registry images, tags, releases, or cache exports exist, and every
candidate's distribution stays blocked or unreviewed pending admission.

Start with the [provider application execution](docs/runtime-contract.md)
contract, then the [native](docs/native.md), [proxy](docs/proxy.md),
[Windows](docs/windows.md), [delivery](docs/delivery.md),
[licensing](docs/licensing.md), and
[adding providers](docs/adding-providers.md) guides. `examples/` holds
runnable consumers, including the optional p11-kit and p11scope
demonstrations.
